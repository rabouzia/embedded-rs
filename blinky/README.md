# Blinky Project

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of embedded systems programming by toggling an LED at a 1-second (1000ms) interval. It serves as an introductory example to understand GPIO control, timing mechanisms, and basic microcontroller operation.

## Purpose

- Learn how to control hardware peripherals
- Understand timing and delay functions
- Practice basic embedded Rust programming
